## What are tools?

Tools are the building blocks of your GTM (Go-To-Market) automation strategy. They encapsulate repeatable actions—like finding stakeholders, extracting revenue data, or sending emails—so you can scale your workflows and focus on what matters most.

Tools in Cargo are designed to be modular and reusable. You can trigger them in plays, have an agent leverage them or deploy them to an MCP server. 

> The more you invest in your Cargo tool, the more efficient and robust your GTM systems are likely to become.

## Use cases

Tools can be used for a variety of GTM tasks, including:

- **Lead qualification:** Automate the process of qualifying leads based on custom criteria and real-time data.
- **Custom data enrichment:** Pull key company metrics (like 2024 revenue) from multiple sources automatically.
- **Stakeholder discovery:** Find and surface the right contacts at target accounts.
- **Outreach automation:** Send emails or trigger other communications as part of a larger workflow.

## Step-by-step: Build your first tool

Follow these steps to create a simple lead enrichment tool that fetches company data and updates your CRM.

### Step 1: Create a new tool

1. Navigate to **Tools** in your Cargo workspace sidebar
2. Click **+ New Tool** in the top right corner
3. Give your tool a descriptive name (e.g., "Company Enrichment Tool")
4. You'll be taken to the tool editor canvas

### Step 2: Define your inputs

Every tool needs input data to work with. Click on the **Input** node to configure:

1. Add a field for the data you'll receive (e.g., `company_domain` of type `string`)
2. Optionally mark fields as required
3. Add a description to help others understand what data to provide

<Tip>
Use clear, descriptive field names. Future you (and your teammates) will thank you!
</Tip>

### Step 3: Add your first node

Click the **+** button to add a node. For this example, we'll use an **Enrich** node:

1. Select **Enrich** → **Company** from the node picker
2. Connect the Input node's output to the Enrich node's input
3. Map your `company_domain` input to the enrichment node's domain field

### Step 4: Add logic and transformations

Now add downstream actions based on the enriched data:

1. Add a **Branch** node to check if enrichment was successful
2. On the "Yes" path, add a **Write** node to update your CRM
3. On the "No" path, add error handling (e.g., log the failure or send a notification)

### Step 5: Configure outputs

Define what your tool returns:

1. Click on the **Output** node
2. Map the fields you want to return (e.g., company name, employee count, funding stage)
3. These outputs can be used by plays, agents, or external systems

### Step 6: Test your tool

Before publishing, test your tool:

1. Click the **Test** button in the top toolbar
2. Enter sample input data
3. Review the execution flow and check each node's output
4. Fix any errors that appear

### Step 7: Publish

Once everything works:

1. Click **Publish** in the top right corner
2. Your tool is now available in plays, agents, and MCP servers
3. Share the tool with your team

## Best practices

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Start simple" icon="seedling">
    Begin with a minimal tool and add complexity incrementally. This makes debugging easier.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Name nodes clearly" icon="tag">
    Rename nodes to describe their purpose (e.g., "Check if enterprise" instead of "Branch 1").
  </Card>
  <Card title="Handle errors gracefully" icon="shield-check">
    Use Branch nodes to handle failure cases—don't let errors silently fail.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Document your inputs" icon="file-lines">
    Add descriptions to input fields so users know exactly what data to provide.
