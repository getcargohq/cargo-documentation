## What are Tools?

Tools are the building blocks of your GTM (Go-To-Market) automation strategy. They encapsulate repeatable actions—like finding stakeholders, extracting revenue data, or sending emails—so you can scale your workflows and focus on what matters most.

Tools in Cargo are designed to be modular and reusable. You can combine them in different ways to automate a wide range of business processes, making your GTM operations more efficient and adaptable.

## Use cases

Tools can be used for a variety of GTM tasks, including:

- **Lead Qualification:** Automate the process of qualifying leads based on custom criteria and real-time data.
- **Data Extraction:** Pull key company metrics (like 2024 revenue) from multiple sources automatically.
- **Stakeholder Discovery:** Find and surface the right contacts at target accounts.
- **Outreach Automation:** Send emails or trigger other communications as part of a larger workflow.
- **Integration:** Connect with external data sources and services to enrich your GTM processes.

These are just a few examples—Cargo Tools give you the flexibility to build automations as simple or as sophisticated as your GTM strategy demands.
