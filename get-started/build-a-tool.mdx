## What are tools?

Tools are the building blocks of your GTM (Go-To-Market) automation strategy. They encapsulate repeatable actions—like finding stakeholders, extracting revenue data, or sending emails—so you can scale your workflows and focus on what matters most.

Tools in Cargo are designed to be modular and reusable. You can trigger them in plays, have an agent leverage them or deploy them to an MCP server. 

> The more you invest in your Cargo tool, the more efficient and robust your GTM systems are likely to become.

## Use cases

Tools can be used for a variety of GTM tasks, including:

- **Lead qualification:** Automate the process of qualifying leads based on custom criteria and real-time data.
- **Custom data enrichment:** Pull key company metrics (like 2024 revenue) from multiple sources automatically.
- **Stakeholder discovery:** Find and surface the right contacts at target accounts.
- **Outreach automation:** Send emails or trigger other communications as part of a larger workflow.
