Cargo uses a flexible usage-based system, paid for with Cargo credits, which covers everything you do in the platform.

You decide how many credits you need based on your business requirements. All plans include access to every feature—no matter your usage level.

## Subscription plan types

**Self-serve plan** (default) are meant for getting started and understanding how the platform works.

**Plan-based workspaces** are more economical for higher, regular usage. These workspaces come with monthly or annual credit allocations that reset at the end of each term.

**Credits are consumed for:**

| Action                  | Cost                       | Description                                                    |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Integration tasks**   | Listed per integration     | Researching companies, finding contacts, data enrichment, etc. |
| **Orchestration steps** | 1 credit per 100 steps     | Running Plays, Tools and Agents                                |
| **Storage records**     | 1 credit per 1,000 upserts | Storing and retrieving data in Cargo data models               |

## Credit management

### Credit reset and top-ups

Credits reset at the end of each term (monthly or annually) for plan-based workspaces. If you run out of credits before the end of your term, you have two options:

1. **Upgrade your plan** - Move to a different plan tier with more included credits. This requires speaking to someone in the Cargo team
2. **Enable auto-topup** - Automatically purchase additional credits when needed (slightly more expensive than plan credits)
3. **Manage the payment method**- Add a payment card or via a bank transfer

### Credits overage

<Note>Credits overage is only available for Enterprise customers.</Note>

Enterprise customers can enable credits overage to ensure uninterrupted operations. When overage is enabled:

- **Continued usage beyond allocation** - Your workflows continue running even after your credit balance reaches zero
- **Automatic invoicing** - Overage charges are tracked and invoiced automatically every month
- **Same credit rates** - Overage credits are charged at the same rates as your plan credits
