Cargo uses a flexible usage-based system, paid for with Cargo credits, which covers everything you do in the platform.

You decide how many credits you need based on your business requirements. All plans include access to every featureâ€”no matter your usage level.

## Subscription plan types

**Self-serve plan** (default) are meant for getting started and understanding how the platform works.

**Plan-based workspaces** are more economical for higher, regular usage. These workspaces come with monthly or annual credit allocations that reset at the end of each term.

**Credits are consumed for:**

- **Enrichment tasks** - Researching companies, finding contacts, etc.
- **Orchestration workflows** - Running Plays, Tools and Agents
- **Storage actions** - Storing and retrieving data in Cargo data models

## Credit management

### Credit reset and top-ups

Credits reset at the end of each term (monthly or annually) for plan-based workspaces. If you run out of credits before the end of your term, you have two options:

1. **Upgrade your plan** - Move to a different plan tier with more included credits. This requires speaking to someone in the Cargo team
2. **Enable auto-topup** - Automatically purchase additional credits when needed (slightly more expensive than plan credits)
3. **Manage the payment method **- Add a payment card or via a bank transfer

### What happens when credits run out

When your credit balance reaches zero:

- **Enrichment actions are blocked** - Company research, contact finding, and data gathering will be paused
- **Orchestration and storage actions continue** - Plays and automated workflows keep running to avoid disrupting operations
- **Overage fees apply** - Continued orchestration and storage actions incur additional charges which will be invoiced automatically once incurred.
