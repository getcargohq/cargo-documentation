Cargo uses a flexible credit-based system, so you only pay for what you use. 

You decide how many credits you need based on your business requirements. All plans include access to every featureâ€”no matter your usage level.

**Credits are consumed for:**

- **Enrichment tasks** - Researching companies, finding contacts, and gathering data
- **Orchestration workflows** - Running Plays and automated sequences
- **Storage actions** - Storing and retrieving data from your Cargo workspace

**Credit pricing varies by provider:**

- **Company list building:** 0.01 to 3 credits per company
- **Company enrichment:** 1 to 3 credits
- **Decision makers search:** 1 to 3 credits per profile returned
- **Email enrichment:** 1 to 3 credits
- **Phone enrichment:** 3 to 6 credits
