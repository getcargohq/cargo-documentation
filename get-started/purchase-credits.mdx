Cargo uses a flexible credit-based system, so you only pay for what you use.

You decide how many credits you need based on your business requirements. All plans include access to every featureâ€”no matter your usage level.

## Workspace types

**Self-serve workspaces** (default) are designed for exploring and testing Cargo's capabilities. They're perfect for getting started and understanding how the platform works.

**Plan-based workspaces** are more economical for higher, regular usage. These workspaces come with monthly or annual credit allocations that reset at the end of each term.

**Credits are consumed for:**

- **Enrichment tasks** - Researching companies, finding contacts, and gathering data
- **Orchestration workflows** - Running Plays and automated sequences
- **Storage actions** - Storing and retrieving data from your Cargo workspace

**Credit pricing varies by provider:**

- **Company list building:** 0.01 to 3 credits per company
- **Company enrichment:** 1 to 3 credits
- **Decision makers search:** 1 to 3 credits per profile returned
- **Email enrichment:** 1 to 3 credits
- **Phone enrichment:** 3 to 6 credits

## Credit management

### Credit reset and top-ups

Credits reset at the end of each term (monthly or annually) for plan-based workspaces. If you run out of credits before the end of your term, you have two options:

1. **Upgrade your plan** - Move to a higher tier with more included credits
2. **Enable auto-topup** - Automatically purchase additional credits when needed (slightly more expensive than plan credits)

### What happens when credits run out

When your credit balance reaches zero:

- **Enrichment actions are blocked** - Company research, contact finding, and data gathering will be paused
- **Orchestration and storage actions continue** - Plays and automated workflows keep running to avoid disrupting operations
- **Overage fees apply** - Continued orchestration and storage actions incur additional charges which will be invoiced automatically once incurred.
