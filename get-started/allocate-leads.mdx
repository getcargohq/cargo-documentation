## What is lead allocation?

Lead allocation is the process of assigning incoming leads to the right sales reps, teams, or territories.

> Getting this right is critical for maximizing speed-to-lead, rep productivity, and conversion rates.

Cargo lets you automate lead allocation using custom rules and real-time data, so every lead goes to the best possible owner, at the right time.

## Use cases

- **Territory-based routing:** Assign leads based on geography, company size, or industry.
- **Round robin:** Distribute leads evenly across your team to ensure a fair workload.
- **Priority assignment:** Route high-value or urgent leads to your top performers.
- **Custom logic:** Use any data point or business rule to create your allocation strategy.

## Step-by-step: Set up lead allocation

Follow these steps to configure automated lead distribution in your workspace.

### Step 1: Connect your sales organization

1. Navigate to **Allocation** in your Cargo workspace sidebar
2. Connect a tool containing your sales organization (such as your CRM)
3. Cargo automatically imports team members and keeps them synchronized

<Tip>
  Enhance member profiles with custom metadata—like spoken languages or
  specializations—to enable smarter routing.
</Tip>

### Step 2: Create territories

Territories group members into logical units that match your sales structure:

1. Go to the **Territories** tab
2. Click **+ New Territory**
3. Name your territory (e.g., "EMEA Enterprise" or "Healthcare Vertical")
4. Add members who should receive leads in this territory
5. Optionally designate a **fallback member** for when others hit capacity

### Step 3: Configure capacity limits

Capacity settings prevent rep overload and ensure fair distribution:

1. Navigate to the **Capacity** tab
2. Click **+ New Capacity**
3. Set the maximum allocations per member (e.g., 3 leads per day)
4. Define the timeframe for the limit

<Note>
  Capacities are calculated independently—a member can be available under one
  capacity while fully booked under another.
</Note>

### Step 4: Add an allocation node to your play

1. Open or create a play that processes incoming leads
2. Add an **Allocation** node from the node picker
3. Configure how leads should be matched:
   - **Territory** — Assign to members within a specific territory
   - **Email address** — Route based on the lead's email domain
   - **Round robin** — Distribute evenly across available reps
   - **Connector matching** — Use data from connected tools

### Step 5: Test and publish

1. Click **Test** to simulate an allocation with sample data
2. Verify the lead routes to the expected member
3. Publish your play to activate the allocation rules

## Best practices

- **Start with round robin** — Begin with simple even distribution, then add complexity as your routing needs evolve.
- **Set realistic capacity** — Base limits on your team's actual throughput—overloading reps hurts conversion rates.
- **Use fallback members** — Always designate fallbacks so no lead ever goes unassigned.
- **Monitor allocation history** — Regularly audit assignments to ensure rules work as expected.
