## What is lead allocation?

Lead allocation is the process of assigning incoming leads to the right sales reps, teams, or territories. Getting this right is critical for maximizing speed-to-lead, rep productivity, and conversion rates.

Cargo lets you automate lead allocation using custom rules and real-time dataâ€”so every lead goes to the best possible owner, instantly.

## Use cases

- **Territory-based routing:** Assign leads based on geography, company size, or industry.
- **Round robin:** Distribute leads evenly across your team to ensure fair workload.
- **Priority assignment:** Route high-value or urgent leads to your top performers.
- **Custom logic:** Use any data point or business rule to create your own allocation strategy.

Cargo makes it easy to adapt your lead allocation process as your team and business needs evolve.
