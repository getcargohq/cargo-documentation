## What are Plays?

Plays are automated workflows in Cargo that let you build and execute repeatable go-to-market strategies. Cargo handles the logistics of coordinating and scaling every detail—so you can focus on outcomes, not operations.

Building scalable and effective sales, marketing, and GTM strategies with Cargo means successfully coordinating two key components:

- **Data:** Modern GTM teams rely on data from many sources—CRMs, enrichment tools, product usage, and more. Cargo brings all this data together, so you can trigger actions based on the most up-to-date information.
- **Actions:** Cargo Plays give you the ability to add custom logic—whether it's researching companies, identifying decision-makers, launching multi-channel outreach, or building entirely new workflows. You decide what happens, and when.

Cargo is a purpose-built system of action. Plays let you define a series of steps—powered by your tools—that run automatically on companies or people, triggered by your data models and business rules.

## Use cases

Plays are versatile: you can use them for everything from standard outbound to advanced, data-driven growth campaigns. Here are some of the most popular ways Cargo customers use Plays:

- **Warm Outbound:** Automatically reach out to prospects at companies showing intent signals, with personalized messaging at just the right moment.
- **Champion Tracking:** Monitor champions of your product and engage them when they move to new companies or roles.
- **List Building:** Turn a static list of companies into high-quality leads by enriching data and finding new contacts in relevant roles.
- **Automated Lead Routing:** Instantly assign leads to the right reps based on territory, fit, or engagement signals.
- **Multi-step Nurture:** Orchestrate complex, multi-channel nurture sequences that adapt to real-time data and engagement.
