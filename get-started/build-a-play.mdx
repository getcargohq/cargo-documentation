## What are plays?

Plays are automated workflows in Cargo that **consume data from a Cargo data model** to **programmatically trigger at the right moment **in order to execute a pre-defined workflow logic.

Plays let you build workflow logic using **actions** and **tools** and run automatically whenever a relevant change is oberved in the connected data model:

- **Actions:** Cargo plays give you the ability to add custom logic that is triggered when the right changes are observed in the connected data model.
- **Data:** GTM teams rely on data from many sourcesâ€”CRMs, enrichment tools, product usage, and more. Cargo data models are able to unify this data, so you can trigger plays based on the most relevant changes in that data.
- **Syncs:** Plays can process records in batches on a schedule you define, letting you control how often the play checks for new data and how many records to process at once.

## Use cases

Here are some of the most popular ways Cargo customers use Plays:

- **Warm outbound:** Automatically reach out to prospects at companies showing intent signals, with personalized messaging at just the right moment.
- **Champions tracking:** Monitor champions of your product and engage them when they move to new companies or roles.
- **Stakeholder research:** Turn a list of companies into high-relevance leads by finding new contacts in relevant roles to engage with
- **Automated Lead Routing:** Instantly assign leads to the right reps based on territory, fit, or engagement signals.
- **CRM operations:** Detect errant data in your CRM systems, whether it be invalid emails or duplicate records, and trigger a custom workflow logic to remedy it.
