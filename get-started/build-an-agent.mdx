## What are Agents?

Agents are intelligent components in Cargo that research and answer questions about companies and people. They use state-of-the-art AI to automate research, qualify leads, and enrich your CRM with up-to-date insights.

Agents can be configured to run custom logic, search the web, and provide answers to your most important GTM questions—so your team can focus on high-value activities.

## Use cases

Agents can be used for a variety of GTM tasks, including:

- **Automated Research:** Instantly gather information on companies and people from public and private data sources.
- **Lead & Account Qualification:** Qualify leads and accounts based on custom rules and real-time data.
- **CRM Enrichment:** Keep your CRM up to date with the latest insights and contact information.
- **Workflow Automation:** Power custom workflows in your Plays by providing answers and data to other tools.

These are just a few examples—Cargo Agents give you the flexibility to automate research and qualification as part of your GTM strategy.
