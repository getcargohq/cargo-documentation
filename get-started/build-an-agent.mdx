## What are agents?

Agents are intelligent actors in Cargo that reason and answer open-ended questions relevant to your GTM processes. They use foundational AI models to leverage semantic reasoning to trigger the right set of tools, resources or MCP servers to achieve the task given to them.

Modern GTM teams leverage agents in their systems to automate research, qualify leads, enrich your CRM and improve the productivity of their sales teams. Once set up, Cargo agents can be prompted from a variety of places, including a Slack channel, a Chrome extension, an API endpoint or a Cargo play.

## Use cases

Agents can be used for a variety of GTM tasks, including:

- **Automated research:** The agent can use its reasoning to sift through information on companies and people and retain the most relevant intelligence for the task at hand.
- **Lead and account qualification:** Qualify leads and accounts based on custom rules and real-time data.
- **Sales enablement:** Agents can use a wide-range of context about a deal or an incident, to provide guidance on the next best step to assist a sales team member's job.
