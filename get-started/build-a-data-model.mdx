## What are data models?

Data models are structured tables that power your Cargo plays. They contain organized data that can be imported into plays to create runs.

Cargo enables you to build data models from multiple sources—API endpoints, webhook events, and SQL queries—and merge them into a unified, cohesive structure.

<Note>
  Cargo uses a data warehouse infrastructure to host your data models. By
  default, you'll get a managed Snowflake instance, or you can connect your own
  warehouse.
</Note>

## Data connectors

Cargo offers three types of data loaders to bring external data into your data models:

| Connector               | Description                                                                                                  |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Native integrations** | Connect to supported external APIs (CRMs, enrichment tools, etc.) and fetch data directly into a data model. |
| **Webhook loader**      | Listen for real-time events from external sources and import that data automatically.                        |
| **SQL loader**          | Run SQL queries on your data warehouse tables and import the results.                                        |
