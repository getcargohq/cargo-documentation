## What are data models?

Cargo plays are powered by underlying data models, which are structured tables containing organized data. Data from these models can be imported into a workflow to generate runs.

To ensure efficient data management, Cargo leverages a data warehouse infrastructure to host these models. This warehouse collects, manages, and stores data for each workspace, ensuring accuracy, consistency, and accessibility across all data models within that workspace.

Cargo enables users to create data models from a variety of external and internal sources, including API endpoints, webhook events, and SQL queries on warehouse tables. This integration allows users to merge multiple data sources into a unified, cohesive model.

By supporting data model creation from both external sources and existing models within Cargo, the platform provides a flexible way to consolidate diverse datasets under a common schema.

## Data connectors

Among all of the integrations available in Cargo, those available as storage connectors allow the user to bring external data to a data model using a data loader. This capability enables you to unify data from various sources, such as data warehouses, CRMs, marketing automation platforms, etc. into a single, unified model.


There are three types of data loaders available in Cargo:

**Native integrations:** These loaders allows you to connect to a supported external API endpoint to fetch data and import it into a data model.

**Webhook data loader:** This loader allows you to listen for events from an external source and import the data into a data model.

**SQL data loader:** This loader allows you to run SQL queries on tables in the data warehouse and import the results into a data model.

## Advanced features

Models support several advanced features, such as:

**Creating segments:** Apply filters to data models to form segments, allowing for targeted plays based on specific criteria.

**Change-based triggers:** Enable plays to respond in real-time to updates, additions, or deletions in the data, ensuring action based on the most pertinent signals.

**Set enrolment conditions:** Track records to prevent plays from processing the same data multiple times.

**Model relationships:** Useful for creating a comprehensive view of your data. By connecting different models using common identifiers, you can create merged views of your customer data from different sources.

**Custom columns:** Lets you add calculated fields or tags to existing rows in a model.
- Custom columns: These columns are free-form columns that you can upsert data into from within a play.
- Computed columns: Calculate values based on other columns in the model.
- Metrics columns: Store aggregated data, such as sums, averages, or counts, based on the values in other columns in other models

**Setting up system of record:** Allow using your own warehouse instance as a system of record accessible by Cargo.
