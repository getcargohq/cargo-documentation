Attio is a modern customer relationship management tool that's easy to get started with and scales with your team's operations. Cargo's native integration with Attio allows you to both pull data from the CRM as part of data models, and write or delete data from all CRM objects to maintain it.

## How to set up Attio

{/* ARCADE EMBED START*/}<div style={{position: "relative", paddingBottom: "calc(62.5% + 41px)", height: 0, width: "100%"}}><iframe src="https://demo.arcade.software/lmvsg4b9DhVVkKuq3hQI?embed&embed_mobile=inline&embed_desktop=inline&show_copy_link=true" title="Setup a data model" frameBorder="0" loading="lazy" webkitAllowFullScreen mozAllowFullScreen allowFullScreen allow="clipboard-write" style={{position: "absolute", top: 0, left: 0, width: "100%", height: "100%", colorScheme: "light"}} ></iframe></div>{/*ARCADE EMBED END */}

Attio uses your logged-in instance to establish the sync with Cargo. During connection, you'll be asked to authorize Cargo with the following permissions:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Required permissions">
    - Read and write records - Read object configuration - Read list entries -
    Read and write comments - Read and write notes - Read and write tasks - Read
    user management settings - Read list configuration
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

Once redirected and the connector is created, you can:

- **Set up an Attio data model** — Create data models from your Attio objects to trigger Plays and power model search actions.

- **Use Attio in workflows** — Choose **Attio** from the node catalog within a **Play**, **Tool**, or **Agent**.
