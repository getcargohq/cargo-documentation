description: "This page outlines how to use the HubSpot integration to pull and manage CRM data in Cargo."
---

HubSpot is an all-in-one CRM platform that helps businesses manage marketing, sales, and customer service. Cargo's native integration with HubSpot allows you to both pull data from the CRM as part of data models, and write or delete data from all CRM objects to maintain it.

## How to set up HubSpot

HubSpot uses OAuth to establish the sync with Cargo. During connection, you'll be asked to authorize Cargo.

Once redirected and the connector is created, you can:

- **Set up a HubSpot data model** — Create data models from your HubSpot objects to trigger Plays and power model search actions.
- **Use HubSpot in workflows** — Choose **HubSpot** from the node catalog within a **Play**, **Tool**, or **Agent**.
