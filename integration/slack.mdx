Slack is a leading business communication platform that brings teams together with real-time messaging, channels, and integrations. Cargo's native integration with Slack allows you to send messages, notifications, and alerts directly to channels or users as part of your workflows.

## How to set up Slack

Slack uses OAuth to establish the connection with Cargo. During connection, you'll be asked to authorize Cargo to access your Slack workspace.

Once redirected and the connector is created, you can:

- **Send messages from workflows** — Send notifications, alerts, and updates to Slack channels or users directly from your **Plays**, **Tools**, or **Agents**.
- **Keep teams informed** — Automate real-time notifications for important events like new leads, deal updates, or workflow completions.

## Slack actions

### Send message to channel

Post a message to a public or private Slack channel.

**Use cases**

- **Team notifications** – Alert your sales team when a high-value lead enters the pipeline
- **Deal updates** – Post to a deals channel when opportunities progress through stages
- **Workflow alerts** – Notify teams when automated workflows complete or require attention

<Tip>
  Use Slack's [Block Kit](https://api.slack.com/block-kit) formatting to create
  rich, interactive messages with buttons, sections, and more.
</Tip>

### Send direct message

Send a private message directly to a Slack user.

**Use cases**

- **Personal notifications** – Notify a specific rep when they're assigned a new lead
- **Task reminders** – Send individual reminders for follow-ups or pending actions
- **Escalations** – Alert managers directly when deals need attention

### Post threaded reply

Reply to an existing message in a thread.

**Use cases**

- **Conversation continuity** – Keep related updates organized in threads
- **Status updates** – Add progress updates to existing notification threads
- **Collaborative workflows** – Build context over time within a single thread

<Info>
  To post a threaded reply, you'll need the `thread_ts` (timestamp) of the
  parent message. This can be captured from a previous **Send message** action.

## Message formatting

Slack supports rich text formatting using markdown-like syntax:

| Format            | Syntax          | Example                     |
| ----------------- | --------------- | --------------------------- |
| **Bold**          | `*text*`        | _important_                 |
| _Italic_          | `_text_`        | _emphasis_                  |
| ~~Strikethrough~~ | `~text~`        | ~removed~                   |
| `Code`            | `` `text` ``    | `variable`                  |
| Link              | `<url\|text>`   | `<https://cargo.io\|Cargo>` |
| User mention      | `<@USER_ID>`    | `<@U123ABC>`                |
| Channel mention   | `<#CHANNEL_ID>` | `<#C123ABC>`                |

<Warning>
  Ensure the Cargo app has been invited to private channels before attempting to
  post messages. The bot cannot access channels it hasn't been added to.
</Warning>

## Common patterns

### Lead assignment notifications

Notify reps instantly when new leads are assigned to them:

1. **Trigger** – Play triggers on lead assignment
2. **Enrich** – Gather lead details and context
3. **Send DM** – Notify the assigned rep via direct message with lead summary

### Deal stage alerts

Keep your team informed about pipeline movement:

1. **Trigger** – Play triggers on opportunity stage change
2. **Condition** – Check if deal moved to a key stage (e.g., "Negotiation")
3. **Post to channel** – Send a formatted message to your deals channel

<Tip>
  Combine Slack notifications with other actions to create powerful workflows.
  For example, enrich a lead, update your CRM, and notify your team—all in a
  single Play.
