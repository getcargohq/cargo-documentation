Cargo is built with security at its core. We understand that you're trusting us with sensitive business data, and we take that responsibility seriously.

## Infrastructure security

| Feature               | Description                                                                                                               |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Cloud hosting**     | Cargo runs on enterprise-grade cloud infrastructure with 99.9% uptime SLA, automatic failover, and geo-redundant backups. |
| **Network isolation** | All services are designed to run in isolated virtual private clouds, with strict network policies and firewall rules.     |

## Data protection

### Encryption

All data is encrypted both in transit and at rest:

| Layer      | Protection                                               |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| In transit | TLS 1.3 encryption for all API and web traffic           |
| At rest    | AES-256 encryption for all stored data                   |
| Database   | Encrypted storage with customer-isolated data partitions |
| Backups    | Encrypted backups with point-in-time recovery            |

### Data handling

<Steps>
  <Step title="Minimal data retention">
    Cargo only stores data necessary to run your workflows. Intermediate
    processing data is automatically purged after execution.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Customer isolation">
    Each workspace's data is logically isolated. Strict access controls ensure
    no cross-tenant data access.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Secure deletion">
    When you delete data or close your account, we permanently remove all
    associated data from our systems.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Access control

### Authentication

- **Single Sign-On (SSO)**: Connect your identity provider for centralized authentication
- **Multi-factor authentication (MFA)**: Add an extra layer of security to user accounts
- **API keys**: Scoped, rotatable keys for programmatic access with granular permissions

### Permissions

Cargo provides role-based access control (RBAC) to manage what users can do within your workspace:

| Role   | Capabilities                                                   |
| ------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Admin  | Full access to all settings, integrations, and user management |
| Editor | Create and modify tools, agents, plays, and data models        |
| Viewer | Read-only access to view workflows and results                 |

## Compliance

| Certification     | Description                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **SOC 2 Type II** | Cargo maintains SOC 2 Type II certification, demonstrating our commitment to security, availability, and confidentiality.                                                          |
| **GDPR-aligned**  | We align with GDPR requirements and provide Data Processing Agreements (DPA) as well as support data subject access requests. Note: Cargo does not hold formal GDPR certification. |

### Data residency

Cargo supports data residency requirements for customers with specific regional data storage needs. Contact us to discuss your requirements.

## Integration security

### Warehouse connections

When connecting to your data warehouse (Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift), Cargo:

- Uses read-only credentials where possible
- Connects via secure, encrypted channels
- Never stores raw credentials — they're encrypted and isolated in secure vaults

### CRM and third-party integrations

All OAuth connections follow best practices:

- Minimal permission scopes requested
- Tokens securely stored and automatically refreshed
- Connections can be revoked at any time from your workspace

## Monitoring and incident response

| Feature               | Description                                                                                 |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **24/7 monitoring**   | Automated systems continuously monitor for security threats and anomalies.                  |
| **Incident response** | Documented incident response procedures with defined SLAs for communication and resolution. |
