title: Launching a tool
description: Tools in Cargo can be launched through multiple methods depending on your use case
---

Once you've built and published a tool, there are several ways to execute it. Choose the method that best fits your use case.

## Launch tab

The most direct way to launch a tool is through the **Launch** tab in the Cargo interface.

### Single run

Execute a tool once with specific parameters:

1. Navigate to your tool in the Cargo workspace
2. Click on the **Launch** tab
3. Select **Single** mode
4. Enter the required input parameters
5. Click **Run tool** to execute immediately

<Tip>
Single runs are perfect for testing tools or processing one-off requests without setting up a full workflow.
</Tip>

### Bulk run

Process multiple records at once:

1. Navigate to your tool and select the **Launch** tab
2. Choose **Bulk** mode
3. Upload a CSV file containing multiple input records
4. Map the CSV columns to your tool's input fields
5. Click **Continue** to process the entire batch

Your CSV should have headers that match your tool's input field names. For example:

```csv
company_domain,contact_email
acme.com,john@acme.com
globex.io,jane@globex.io
```

## Through a play

Integrate tools into automated workflows by adding them as actions in a play.

1. Create or edit a play
2. Add your tool as a node in the play
3. Map inputs from previous play nodes or enrolled data
4. Configure what happens with the tool's output

The tool executes automatically when the play runs, and its results can be passed to subsequent actions. This is ideal for building multi-step automation sequences.

## Through an agent

AI agents can autonomously decide when and how to use your tools.

1. Open your agent's configuration
2. Add your tool to the agent's available tools
3. The agent will automatically launch the tool when relevant to the conversation

Tool results feed into the agent's reasoning process, enabling sophisticated workflows where the agent chains multiple tools together based on context.

## Through an MCP server

[Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) allows external AI systems to discover and use your tools.

1. Enable MCP server in your Cargo workspace settings
2. Configure which tools are exposed via MCP
3. Connect your MCP client (Claude Desktop, VS Code, etc.)
4. Your tools appear as available actions in the external system

This is powerful for integrating Cargo tools with AI assistants and development environments.

---

## Through API calls

Execute tools programmatically via the REST API for maximum flexibility and integration options.

### Getting your API credentials

1. Navigate to **Settings** → **API** in your Cargo workspace
2. Generate or copy your API token
3. Find your tool's ID in the tool editor URL or settings

### API endpoint

```
POST https://api.getcargo.io/v1/tools/{tool_id}/execute
```

### Example request

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.getcargo.io/v1/tools/{tool_id}/execute?token={your_token}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "company_domain": "acme.com",
    "contact_email": "john@acme.com"
  }'
```

### Example response

```json
{
  "execution_id": "exec_abc123",
  "status": "completed",
  "output": {
    "company_name": "Acme Corporation",
    "employee_count": 500,
    "industry": "Technology"
  }
}
```

### Async execution

For long-running tools, use async mode:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.getcargo.io/v1/tools/{tool_id}/execute?token={your_token}&async=true" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"company_domain": "acme.com"}'
```

This returns immediately with an `execution_id` that you can poll for results:

```bash
curl "https://api.getcargo.io/v1/executions/{execution_id}?token={your_token}"
```

### Webhook callbacks

Configure a webhook URL to receive results when the tool completes:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.getcargo.io/v1/tools/{tool_id}/execute?token={your_token}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "company_domain": "acme.com",
    "webhook_url": "https://your-server.com/cargo-callback"
  }'
```

## Choosing the right launch method

| Method | Best for | Automation level |
|--------|----------|------------------|
| **Launch tab** | Testing, ad-hoc execution, bulk imports | Manual |
| **Plays** | Scheduled workflows, multi-step automation | Fully automated |
| **Agents** | Context-aware, intelligent automation | AI-driven |
| **MCP server** | External AI system integration | AI-driven |
| **API** | Custom applications, programmatic access | Fully automated |
