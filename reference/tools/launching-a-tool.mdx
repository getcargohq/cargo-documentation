title: Launching a Tool
description: Tools in Cargo can be launched through multiple methods depending on your use case
---

## 1. Launch tab (Single or bulk runs)

The most direct way to launch a tool is through the launch tab in the Cargo interface.

### Single run
- Navigate to your tool in the Cargo workspace
- Click on the "Launch" tab
- Select "Single" mode
- Enter the required input parameters
- Click "Run tool" to execute immediately

### Bulk run
- Navigate to your tool in the Cargo workspace
- Click on the "Launch" tab
- Select "Bulk" mode
- Upload a file with multiple input records
- Click "Continue" to process the batch

**Use cases:** Testing tools, one-off executions, processing small datasets

## 2. Through a play

Tools can be integrated into plays as nodes within automated workflows.

### How it works:
- Add your tool as an action in a play
- Configure the tool's inputs using data from previous actions
- The tool will execute automatically when the play runs
- Results can be passed to subsequent actions in the workflow

**Use cases:** Automated workflows, multi-step processes, conditional logic

## 3. Through an agent

Agents can trigger tools as part of their research and qualification processes.

### How it works:
- Configure an agent to use specific tools
- The agent will automatically launch tools when needed
- Tool results feed into the agent's decision-making process
- Agents can chain multiple tools together

**Use cases:** Automated research, intelligent data gathering, AI-powered workflows

## 4. Through an MCP server

Tools can be launched programmatically through MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers.

### How it works:
- Set up an MCP server connection
- Use the MCP protocol to send tool execution requests
- Tools run on the server and return results
- Integrates with external systems and workflows

**Use cases:** External integrations, custom applications, server-side automation

## 5. Through API calls

Tools can be executed directly via REST API calls for programmatic access.

### Single tool execution
```bash
POST https://api.getcargo.io/v1/tools/{tool-id}/execute
```

**Request body:**
```json
{
  "key": "value"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "createdAt": "timestamp",
  "finishedAt": "timestamp",
  "input": {
    "key": "value"
  },
  "output": {
    "key": "value"
  }
}
```

### Batch tool execution
```bash
POST https://api.getcargo.io/v1/tools/{tool-id}/batches
```

**Request body:**
```json
{
  "webhookUrl": "https://webhook.url",
  "data": [
    {
      "key": "value"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "batch": {
    "uuid": "__BATCH_UUID__",
    "status": "running"
  }
}
```

### Authentication
Include your API token in the request header:
```json
{
  "Content-Type": "application/json",
  "Authorization": "Basic __TOKEN__"
}
```

**Use cases:** Custom integrations, automated systems, third-party applications

## Choosing the right method

- **Launch tab:** For manual testing and small-scale operations
- **Plays:** For automated workflows and complex business logic
- **Agents:** For AI-powered research and intelligent automation
- **MCP server:** For external system integrations
- **API calls:** For programmatic access and custom applications

Each method offers different levels of automation, integration capabilities, and complexity. Choose based on your specific use case and technical requirements.
