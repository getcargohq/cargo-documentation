title: "Defining the Instructions"
description: "The instructions are the foundation of your Agent's behavior—defining its mission, approach, and constraints."
---

The instructions (also called the "prompt") tell your Agent who it is, what it should do, and what it should avoid. A well-crafted prompt is the difference between an Agent that delivers consistent, high-quality results and one that produces unpredictable outputs.

## The three components

Every Agent prompt consists of three sections:

### 1. Role / Purpose

Defines **who the Agent is** and **what it's trying to achieve**. This sets the primary context for the LLM.

<Tip>
  Keep this concise and focused on the end goal. One or two sentences is ideal.
</Tip>

**Example:**

```
You are a lead qualification specialist for Cargo. Your job is to evaluate
LinkedIn company URLs and determine if they match our Ideal Customer Profile.
```

### 2. Behavior

Outlines **how the Agent should work**—the steps it takes, tools it uses, and the format of its output. This directly guides the Agent's planning phase.

**Example:**

```
1. Use the "Company-Lookup" tool to retrieve company data from the URL
2. Check the company against our ICP criteria in the Knowledge Base
3. Assign a qualification score: "High Fit", "Medium Fit", or "No Fit"
4. Provide a 2-3 sentence explanation of your reasoning
```

<Note>
  **Tool selection tip**: Give each tool a specific name and clear description.
  The Agent uses these to decide which tool to call and when.
</Note>

### 3. Avoidances

Establishes **what the Agent must NOT do**. These guardrails prevent undesired actions and ensure compliance.

**Example:**

```
- Never share proprietary ICP criteria with external parties
- Do not make up information if a lookup fails—report the failure instead
- Avoid overly casual language; maintain a professional tone
```

<Warning>
  Avoidances are critical for security, compliance, and maintaining trust. Be
  explicit about sensitive data handling and edge cases.
</Warning>

## Best practices

| Practice                 | Why it matters                                                                                           |
| :----------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Be specific**          | Vague instructions lead to inconsistent results. Say "assign a score of 1-10" instead of "rate the lead" |
| **Define output format** | Specify exactly what the Agent should return (JSON, bullet points, a score, etc.)                        |
| **List tools by name**   | Reference the exact tool names so the Agent knows what's available                                       |
| **Handle edge cases**    | Tell the Agent what to do when data is missing or a tool fails                                           |
| **Test iteratively**     | Run test queries and refine the prompt based on actual outputs                                           |

## Example: Complete prompt

Here's a full prompt for a lead qualification Agent:

```
ROLE:
You are a lead qualification specialist for Cargo. Evaluate inbound leads
and determine their fit based on our ICP criteria.

BEHAVIOR:
1. Extract the company domain from the lead's email address
2. Use "Enrichment-Tool" to gather company data (size, industry, funding)
3. Query the "ICP-Guidelines" resource to retrieve qualification criteria
4. Score the lead as "High", "Medium", or "Low" fit
5. Return a JSON object with: score, reasoning, and recommended next step

AVOIDANCES:
- Do not qualify leads from personal email domains (gmail, yahoo, etc.)
- Never fabricate company data—if enrichment fails, mark as "Needs Review"
- Do not recommend sales outreach for "Low" fit leads
```
