- **Model Selection:**
  - **Available Providers:** Agents can be powered by leading models from **OpenAI**, **Gemini**, or **Anthropic**.
  - **Selection Criteria:** Choose your model based on the specific trade-off between **reasoning depth** (e.g., for complex analysis) and **speed/cost** (e.g., for simple classification).
- **Behavioral Parameters:**
  - **Reasoning Steps:** Defines the maximum number of logical sub-tasks the Agent is allowed to perform to reach a conclusion. Higher limits allow for deeper problem-solving but increase latency.
  - **Temperature:** Controls the creativity and variability of the output.
    - **Low Temperature (e.g., 0.0 - 0.2):** Deterministic and precise. Best for data extraction, coding, and classification.
    - **High Temperature (e.g., 0.7+):** Creative and varied. Best for copywriting, brainstorming, or conversational engagement.
