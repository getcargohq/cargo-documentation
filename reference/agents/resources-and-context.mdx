description: "Connect your Agent to internal knowledge bases, CRM data, and custom databases to ground its reasoning in facts."

Resources give your Agent access to your organization's data—CRM records, knowledge bases, product databases, and more. This is called **RAG** (Retrieval-Augmented Generation): the Agent retrieves relevant information before generating responses.

<Note>
Without resources, an Agent only knows what's in its instructions and what it can find via web search. Resources ground the Agent in **your** data.

## Supported data sources

| Data type | Examples | Best for |
| :-------- | :------- | :------- |
| **CRM Objects** | HubSpot Deals, Salesforce Accounts, Attio Records | GTM operations, deal context, account history |
| **Knowledge Bases** | Notion, Google Docs, uploaded files | Playbooks, FAQs, ICP definitions, objection handling |
| **Product Data** | Usage databases, analytics platforms | Churn detection, usage-based qualification, health scores |
| **Custom Databases** | SQL databases, BigQuery, Snowflake, Redshift | Any internal data with a query interface |

## Query modes

When an Agent needs to retrieve data, it uses one of two query modes:

### SQL Mode
The Agent generates and executes SQL queries against structured data.

**Best for:**
- Filtering records by specific criteria
- Sorting and aggregating data
- Retrieving specific fields from tables

**Example:**
> "Find all deals in the Discovery stage with value over $50k"

### Vector Mode
The Agent uses semantic similarity search to find relevant text chunks.

**Best for:**
- Searching unstructured documents (PDFs, transcripts, notes)
- Finding conceptually related content
- Answering questions from knowledge bases

**Example:**
> "What does our playbook say about handling pricing objections?"

## Configuring a resource

Click on any connected resource to access its settings:

### Model
Specifies which data object to query (e.g., the `Deals` object in HubSpot, or a specific Notion database).

### Prompt / Guidelines
Custom instructions for how the Agent should query or interpret this resource.

**Example:**
```
When querying deals, prioritize high-value opportunities 
(>$100k) and exclude any marked as "Closed Lost".
```

### Filters
Restrict which data the Agent can access. Use filters to:
- Limit to specific record types or stages
- Exclude sensitive or irrelevant data
- Focus on a particular team's records

### Selected Columns (SQL Mode only)
Choose which fields to return. This improves performance by:
- Reducing the amount of data in the context window
- Speeding up query execution
- Focusing the Agent on relevant information

### Limit
Set the maximum number of records returned per query. Balance between:
- **Higher limits:** More comprehensive results, but slower and more expensive
- **Lower limits:** Faster responses, but may miss relevant data

## Best practices

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Start with filters">
    Narrow down data access to what the Agent actually needs. Less noise = better reasoning.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Write clear guidelines">
    Help the Agent understand how to query your data and what matters most.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Choose the right mode">
    Use SQL for structured queries, Vector for document search. Don't mix them up.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Test your queries">
    Run test prompts to verify the Agent retrieves the right data before deploying.
