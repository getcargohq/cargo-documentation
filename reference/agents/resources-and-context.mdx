Resources give your Agent access to your organization's data—CRM records, knowledge bases, product databases, and more. This is called **RAG** (Retrieval-Augmented Generation): the Agent retrieves relevant information before generating responses.

<Note>
  Without resources, an Agent only knows what's in its instructions and what it
  can find via web search. Resources ground the Agent in **your** data.

## Types of resources

There are two types of resources you can connect to your Agent:

| Type                                               | Data format       | Examples                                         |
| :------------------------------------------------- | :---------------- | :----------------------------------------------- |
| [**Models**](/reference/resources/models/overview) | Structured data   | CRM objects, product databases, SQL tables       |
| [**Files**](/reference/resources/files/overview)   | Unstructured data | PDFs, documents, transcripts, knowledge articles |

### Models

Models connect your Agent to **structured data**—tables with rows and columns. The Agent queries this data using SQL, making it ideal for filtering, sorting, and aggregating records.

**Best for:**

- CRM Objects (HubSpot Deals, Salesforce Accounts, Attio Records)
- Product Data (usage databases, analytics platforms)
- Custom Databases (BigQuery, Snowflake)

### Files

Files connect your Agent to **unstructured data**—documents, PDFs, and text content. You select which files or folders to include, and the Agent searches this content using vector similarity to find relevant information.

**Best for:**

- Knowledge Bases (Notion, Google Docs, uploaded files)
- Playbooks, FAQs, and process documentation
- Meeting transcripts and call notes

## Configuring a Model

When you add a Model resource, you configure how the Agent queries your structured data.

### Query mode

Choose how the Agent retrieves data from this model:

| Mode       | Description                                                        | Best for                                          |
| :--------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------ |
| **SQL**    | Agent generates and executes SQL queries against the data          | Filtering, sorting, aggregating records           |
| **Vector** | Agent uses semantic similarity search to find relevant text chunks | Searching text fields, finding conceptual matches |

**SQL example:**

> "Find all deals in the Discovery stage with value over $50k"

**Vector example:**

> "Find companies with product descriptions similar to AI automation"

### Model settings

| Setting              | Description                                                      |
| :------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Model**            | Which data object to query (e.g., HubSpot Deals, a SQL table)    |
| **Prompt**           | Custom instructions for how the Agent should query this resource |
| **Filters**          | Restrict which records the Agent can access                      |
| **Selected Columns** | Choose which fields to return (SQL mode only)                    |
| **Limit**            | Maximum number of records returned per query                     |

## Configuring Files

When you add a File resource, you select the content the Agent can search.

### Selecting content

Choose which files or folders to include. The Agent will search all selected content using vector similarity to find relevant information.

### Prompt

Add custom instructions to guide how the Agent interprets or prioritizes this content.

**Example:**

```
This folder contains our sales playbooks. Prioritize the
objection handling guide when the user asks about pricing concerns.
```

## Best practices

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Start with filters">
    Narrow down data access to what the Agent actually needs. Less noise =
    better reasoning.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Write clear prompts">
    Help the Agent understand how to query your data and what matters most.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Choose the right query mode">
    For Models, use SQL for filtering and aggregating, Vector for semantic
    search.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Test before deploying">
    Run test prompts to verify the Agent retrieves the right data.
