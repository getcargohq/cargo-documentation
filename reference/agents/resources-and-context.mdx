Cargo Agents support connecting to a variety of data sources, allowing for comprehensive grounding across the organization:

| **Data Type**        | **Examples (Source Categories)**                                       | **Purpose**                                                                                          |
| :------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **CRM Objects**      | Hubspot Deals, Salesforce Accounts                                     | Structured data necessary for Go-To-Market (GTM) operations and automation.                          |
| **Knowledge Bases**  | Notion, Google Docs, Internal Files                                    | Unstructured documentation (playbooks, FAQs) used for internal expertise _(ie: ICP, selling points)_ |
| **Product Data**     | Usage databases, Analytics platforms                                   | Structured/semi-structured data for use cases like churn detection or qualification based on usage.  |
| **Custom Databases** | SQL databases, Cloud Data Warehouses _(Bigquery, Snowflake, Redshift)_ | Internal data sources accessible via dedicated integration models.                                   |

**Resource Configuration and Query Modes**

| **Query Mode** | **Mechanism**                                                                                                            | **Data Type Focus**                              | **When to Use**                                                                                  |
| :------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **SQL**        | Uses the LLM to generate and execute structured **SQL queries** against the resource (e.g., _Hubspot Deals_).            | Structured Data (Databases, CRM Tables)          | When the query requires filtering, sorting, or aggregation of specific fields.                   |
| **Vector**     | Uses **vector similarity search** to find text chunks that are semantically (conceptually) related to the Agent's query. | Unstructured Data (Documents, PDFs, Transcripts) | When the query is conceptual and requires finding relevant passages within large bodies of text. |

**Configuration Details**

Once a resource is selected, by clicking on it, you can access the configuration details:

- **Model:** Specifies the specific data object or service to be queried (e.g., _Deals_ object within Hubspot).
- **Prompt/Guidelines:** Custom instructions provided to the LLM on how to phrase queries or interpret the resource data (e.g., _Always prioritize high-value deals_).
- **Filter & Selected Columns:** Allows administrators to restrict the data the Agent can access.
  - **Filter:** Defines specific conditions (e.g., only retrieve deals in 'Discovery' stage).
  - **Selected Columns:** (SQL Mode only) Limits the fields returned, improving performance by reducing context window overhead.
- **Limit:** Sets the maximum number of records or results returned by the query, balancing result quality against retrieval cost and speed.
