title: "Integrating Tools and Actions"
description: "Tools are external APIs that give your Agent the ability to take action—updating CRMs, sending messages, and enriching data."
---

Tools transform your Agent from a reasoning engine into an action-taker. Each tool is an external API endpoint that the Agent can call to interact with the world.

<Note>
  For a complete reference of all available actions and how they're used across
  Cargo, see the [Actions overview](/reference/actions/overview).

## How tools work

When an Agent receives a task, it:

1. **Analyzes** the goal and available tools
2. **Selects** the appropriate tool(s) based on their descriptions
3. **Executes** the tool with the right inputs
4. **Uses the output** to continue reasoning or complete the task

<Note>
  The tool's **description** is critical. The Agent reads this description to
  decide when and how to use the tool. Write descriptions that clearly explain
  what the tool does and when to use it.
</Note>

## Configuring a tool

### Description (The AI Contract)

This plain-language description tells the Agent:

- **What** the tool does
- **When** to use it
- **What inputs** it expects

**Good example:**

```
"Enriches a company using its domain. Returns firmographic data including
employee count, industry, funding, and tech stack. Use this when you need
company information for qualification or research."
```

**Poor example:**

```
"Gets company data"
```

### Input configuration

Control how the Agent provides inputs to the tool:

| Mode                 | Behavior                                              | Use when                                                      |
| :------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Let agent decide** | The Agent autonomously determines inputs from context | Inputs are straightforward and available in the conversation  |
| **Let me decide**    | You explicitly define the input structure             | Inputs require specific formatting or come from fixed sources |

### Bulk execution

Enable this when the Agent should apply the tool across multiple records in a single run. Useful for batch operations like:

- Enriching a list of companies
- Updating multiple CRM records
- Sending notifications to several recipients

## Common tool types

| Category          | Examples                     | Typical use                            |
| :---------------- | :--------------------------- | :------------------------------------- |
| **Enrichment**    | Clearbit, Apollo, FullEnrich | Gather company or contact data         |
| **CRM**           | Salesforce, HubSpot, Attio   | Create/update records, log activities  |
| **Communication** | Slack, Email, Outreach       | Send messages, add to sequences        |
| **Data lookup**   | Internal APIs, SQL queries   | Retrieve custom data from your systems |

## MCP Servers

Cargo Agents support the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**—an open standard for connecting AI models to external tools and data sources. You can connect your Agent to any MCP-compatible server, giving it instant access to a wide ecosystem of pre-built integrations.

Simply provide the server URL, and Cargo will automatically discover and register the available tools. For example, you can connect your Agent to:

- **Notion** — Search pages, create databases, and manage workspace content
- **HeyReach** — Automate LinkedIn outreach and manage campaigns
- **HubSpot** — Access CRM data, manage contacts, and trigger workflows

## Best practices

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Write clear descriptions">
    The Agent relies on descriptions to choose tools. Be specific about what the
    tool does and what it returns.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Name tools descriptively">
    Use names like `Enrich-Company` or `Slack-Notify-Rep` instead of generic
    names like `Tool1`.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Handle failures gracefully">
    In your Agent's instructions, specify what to do if a tool call fails
    (retry, skip, report error).
  </Card>
  <Card title="Limit scope">
    Only give Agents access to the tools they need. Fewer tools = faster, more
    accurate tool selection.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>
