### Creating an agent

Prompts are the main way to give immediate instructions. These can either be user-generated or standardized inside a play. A prompt can be passed to a play via the agent's chat editor or via a trigger from one of its deployments.

The system prompt defines the agent's role, capabilities, and constraints

### Agent components

Agents need access to tools and resources to function and powered by a specific foundational models.

**Tools**

Tools equip agents with specific capabilities like API access to external systems and their responses. These act as the agent's "hands" for interacting with external data sources and services.

**Resources**

Resources are the data sources and knowledge bases that agents can draw from. This can be any data model in your workspace, such as your CRM, a warehouse table, or external databases.

**AI models**

Agents are powered by AI models that provide the reasoning and decision-making capabilities. You can choose between OpenAI or Anthropic models depending on your specific needs and requirements.

**Configuration parameters**
Agents use two main parameters to control their behavior. Reasoning steps define the number of logical steps the agent can take to reach a conclusion. Temperature: controls the creativity and randomness of responses.

### Agent deployment

Once created, agents can be deployed across multiple environments and platforms to integrate with your existing workflows and systems.

**Slack integration**
Agents can be deployed directly in Slack, allowing team members to trigger them via the '@Cargo' tag.

**MCP server deployment**
Agents can be accessed via a Model Context Protocol servers built on Cargo, enabling integration with MCP-clients and REST APIs.

**Play integration**
Agents can be embedded within plays as intelligent nodes, providing non-deterministic research and decision-making capabilities to deterministic workflows.

**Browser extension**
Agents can be triggered via Cargo's chrome extension, enabling the agent to access real-time information from the user's browser.

**API deployment**
Agents can be triggered via a REST API endpoints, allowing external systems and applications to access it.
