title: "2. Building an agent"
description: "Cargo Agents are LLM-powered autonomous workers configured to plan and execute multi-step tasks. They use a reasoning engine to dynamically determine the best path to a goal based on the input context and available tools."

While Cargo Plays follows a pre-defined sequence of steps, Agents use a reasoning engine to dynamically determine the best path to a goal based on the input context and available tools.

You should deploy an Agent when:

- **Inputs are variable:** The data source is unstructured text (emails, website copy, notes) rather than structured JSON.
- **Reasoning is required:** The task requires semantic understanding, categorization, or qualitative assessment rather than simple regex or string matching.
- **Adaptability is needed:** The Agent needs to retry with different parameters or search alternative sources if a first attempt fails.

**Agents can:**

- **Enrich, research, and qualify** accounts and leads using live external data.
- **Update CRM fields,** upsert records, and manage data integrity based on interpreted inputs.
- **Assign owners, push prospects to sequences,** and notify reps via Slack or email.
- **Summarize customer conversations** and extract critical signals (e.g., product interest).
- **Detect risks** (e.g., churn signals, usage drops, job changes) proactively.
- **Allocate each lead to the right rep** based on territory, capacity, and qualification criteria.

### 2. Architecture of an Agent: Configuration details

The Agent's intelligence is defined by a stack of interconnected components.The table below serves as the central reference for the Agent's configuration, with each component linking to a detailed technical section.

| **Component Name**            | **Description**                                                                                                                                         | **Key Technical Sub-Section**                                                                   |
| :---------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Prompt/Goal**            | The mission statement and behavioral guardrails that define the agent's task.                                                                           | [A. Defining the Prompt](https://docs.getcargo.ai/reference/agents/defining-the-prompt)         |
| **2. Capabilities**           | Inherent LLM features that enhance agency (e.g., Memory, WebSearch, Canvas).                                                                            | [B. Native LLM Capabilities](https://docs.getcargo.ai/reference/agents/native-llm-capabilities) |
| **3. Tools/Actions**          | External functions (APIs) the Agent can execute to interact with systems (CRM, Slack, etc.).                                                            | [C. Integrating Tools/Actions](https://docs.getcargo.ai/reference/agents/C-tools-and-actions)   |
| **4. Resources (RAG)**        | The internal knowledge base and data sources used to ground the Agent's reasoning in facts.                                                             | [D. Loading Resources (RAG)](https://docs.getcargo.ai/reference/agents/D-resources-and-context) |
| **5. AI model configuration** | The underlying inference engine (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic) and behavioral parameters (Temperature, Reasoning steps) that drive the Agent's intelligence. | [E. AI Model Configuration](https://docs.getcargo.ai/reference/agents/E-model-configuration)    |

### 3. Agent deployment

Once created, Agents are designed to be deployed directly into the flow of work across key channels:

- **Plays (Workflow Automation):** Agents are triggered by a variety of conditions, including **scheduled intervals** or changes within a **system of records** (CRM, data warehouse tables)
- **Slack:** Agents are called via slash commands or mentions to answer real-time queries. Most common ones includes “enrich a contact”, “generate an account research”, “find most relevants stakeholders”.

- **Chat (**[**Browser extension**](https://www.getcargo.ai/modules/chrome)\*\* or Embedded chat UI in Cargo):\*\* Agents act as a real-time conversational assistant, available both as a **Chrome Extension** (to analyze and provide context on the current browser page, or atop your CRM) or an **Embedded Chat Interface** in Cargo.
- **CRM button:** Allows users to initiate specific, one-click, goal-oriented executions on demand directly from a CRM record.
