## What is a Cargo Agent?

Cargo Agents are AI-powered workers that autonomously complete complex Go-To-Market tasks. Unlike Plays, which follow a pre-defined sequence of steps, Agents use a **reasoning engine** to dynamically determine the best path to a goal based on input context and available tools.

<Note>
  **Agents vs Plays**: Use a Play when your workflow is predictable and
  repeatable. Use an Agent when tasks require reasoning, adaptability, or
  handling variable inputs.
</Note>

## When to use an Agent

Deploy an Agent when:

| Scenario                | Why an Agent?                                                                                            |
| :---------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Variable inputs**     | Your data is unstructured text (emails, website copy, notes) rather than structured JSON                 |
| **Reasoning required**  | The task needs semantic understanding, categorization, or qualitative assessment—not just regex matching |
| **Adaptability needed** | The Agent should retry with different parameters or search alternative sources if initial attempts fail  |

## What Agents can do

Agents excel at tasks that require intelligence and context-awareness:

- **Research & enrichment** — Gather live data on accounts and leads from external sources
- **CRM management** — Update fields, upsert records, and maintain data integrity
- **Routing & notifications** — Assign owners, add prospects to sequences, notify reps via Slack or email
- **Signal extraction** — Summarize conversations and identify product interest or objections
- **Risk detection** — Proactively spot churn signals, usage drops, or job changes
- **Lead allocation** — Route leads to the right rep based on territory, capacity, and qualification

## Agent architecture

An Agent's intelligence comes from five interconnected components:

| Component             | What it does                                                                                                                     | Learn more                                                           |
| :-------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Instructions**      | Defines the Agent's mission, behavior, and constraints                                                                           | [Defining the instructions](/reference/agents/defining-the-prompt)   |
| **Capabilities**      | Built-in LLM features like Memory, Web Search, and Canvas                                                                        | [Native LLM capabilities](/reference/agents/native-llm-capabilities) |
| **Tools & Actions**   | Operations the Agent can perform—from [120+ available actions](/reference/actions/overview) including CRM, Slack, and enrichment | [Integrating tools](/reference/agents/tools-and-actions)             |
| **Resources**         | Knowledge bases and data sources that ground the Agent's reasoning                                                               | [Loading resources](/reference/agents/resources-and-context)         |
| **Advanced settings** | The LLM provider and behavioral parameters (temperature, reasoning, maximum steps)                                               | [Advanced settings](/reference/agents/advanced-settings)             |

## Deploying Agents

Once configured, Agents can be triggered from multiple channels:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Plays">
    Agents integrate directly into Cargo Plays, triggered by: - Scheduled
    intervals - Changes in your system of records (CRM, data warehouse) This is
    ideal for automated, recurring tasks like enrichment or qualification.
  </Accordion>

{" "}

<Accordion title="Slack">
  Call Agents via mentions for real-time queries: - "Enrich this contact" -
  "Generate account research for Acme Corp" - "Find the most relevant
  stakeholders"

<Accordion title="Chat (Browser extension or Embedded UI)">
  Agents work as real-time conversational assistants: - **[Chrome
  Extension](/reference/chrome-extension/overview)** — Analyze the current
  browser page or work atop your CRM - **Embedded Chat** — Access Agents
  directly within the Cargo interface
</Accordion>

  <Accordion title="CRM Button">
