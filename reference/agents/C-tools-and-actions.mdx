Tools are the external API endpoints that allow the Agent to act on the world.

- **Description (The AI Contract):** The plain-language description is critical, as the LLM uses it to determine _when_ and _how_ to call the tool.
- **Input Configuration:**
  - **"Let agent decide":** The Agent autonomously determines inputs from the context.
  - **"Let me decide":** The user explicitly defines the required input structure.
- **Bulk Execution:** Permits the Agent to perform the tool's action across multiple records in a single run.
