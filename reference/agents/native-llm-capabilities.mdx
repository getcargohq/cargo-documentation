## Available capabilities

### Memory

Memory allows Agents to retain and recall information across interactions, enabling personalization and continuity.

| Memory type | Scope | Use case |
| :---------- | :---- | :------- |
| **User Memory** | Persists per end-user | Stores preferences, past interactions, and personal context for tailored responses |
| **Workspace Memory** | Shared across all Agents | Organizational knowledge like company policies, ICP definitions, or team guidelines |
| **Agent Memory** | Current execution only | Short-term context including previous steps and tool outputs within a single run |

<Tip>
Use Workspace Memory for information that all Agents should know—like your ICP criteria or product positioning.
</Tip>

### Web Search

Gives Agents access to real-time information from the internet.

**When to enable:**
- Account research requiring current market data
- Validating company information that may have changed
- Finding recent news, funding announcements, or leadership changes

**Example query:**
> "What is the latest funding round for Acme Corp?"

---

### Canvas

Enables Agents to generate structured, shareable digital assets.

**Supported outputs:**
- Spreadsheets and CSV files
- Text documents
- Formatted reports

**Example use case:**
A user asks: _"Give me a list of CROs in San Francisco."_ 

The Agent researches, compiles the data, and delivers a formatted spreadsheet—ready to download or share.

---

### Suggested Actions

A proactive assistant that recommends the next best step after completing a task.

**How it works:**
1. Agent completes the requested task
2. Analyzes what logical next steps might help the user
3. Offers actionable suggestions

**Example:**
After retrieving a list of contacts, the Agent suggests:
> "Would you like me to add these contacts to Sequence XX?"
> "Should I enrich these contacts with email addresses?"

<Note>
Suggested Actions keep workflows moving and help users discover capabilities they might not have thought to request.
