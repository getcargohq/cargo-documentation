description: "The building blocks that power your workflows across tools, plays, agents, and APIs"
---

Actions are the operations that make things happen in Cargo. They're the individual steps that enrich data, write to CRMs, send messages, apply logic, and connect to external services.

---

## Action categories

Cargo organizes actions into two groups: **workflow actions** for building logic in tools and plays, and **connectors** for integrating with external systems and AI.

### Workflow actions

These actions are available in the **Tool** and **Play** editors for building automation logic:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Logic" icon="code-branch" href="#logic">
    Control workflow behavior with branching, looping, filtering, and custom
    scripts.
  </Card>
  <Card title="AI" icon="sparkles" href="#ai">
    Use LLMs to generate content, extract information, and search documents
    semantically.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Sales" icon="chart-line" href="#sales">
    Purpose-built actions for lead allocation, scoring, and revenue operations.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Storage" icon="hard-drive" href="#storage">
    Read, write, and search data in your Cargo data models.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Universal actions

These actions are available **everywhere in Cargo**—in tools, plays, agents, and via API:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Integrations" icon="plug" href="#integrations">
    Connect to CRMs, enrichment providers, communication tools, and external
    platforms.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Tools" icon="hammer" href="#tools">
    Call other Cargo tools from within your workflows to compose complex
    automations.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Agents" icon="robot" href="#agents">
    Invoke AI agents to handle complex, multi-step reasoning tasks autonomously.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Where actions are used

| Context    | Description                                                                    |
| :--------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Tools**  | Build reusable workflows by connecting actions visually in the tool editor     |
| **Plays**  | Automate data-driven workflows that trigger when data model records change     |
| **Agents** | Give AI the ability to select and execute actions autonomously                 |
| **MCP**    | Expose your Cargo tools to any MCP-compatible AI system (Claude, Cursor, etc.) |
| **API**    | Call tools and actions programmatically from your own applications             |

## Logic

Logic actions control how your workflow executes—branching based on conditions, looping through arrays, or running custom code.

<Note>Logic actions are available in **Tools** and **Plays** only.</Note>

| Action           | Purpose                                                  | Use when...                                            |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Balance**      | Distribute records across multiple routes proportionally | You need even workload distribution                    |
| **Branch**       | Route execution based on a Yes/No condition              | You have a single condition to evaluate                |
| **Delay**        | Pause execution for a specified time                     | You need to wait for external processes or rate limits |
| **Filter**       | Stop execution if a condition is false                   | You want to gate workflow continuation                 |
| **Group**        | Execute a sub-workflow for each item in an array         | You're processing multiple records                     |
| **Human Review** | Pause for human approval via Slack                       | You need manual approval before proceeding             |
| **Script**       | Run custom JavaScript code                               | You need custom logic or transformations               |
| **Split**        | Randomly route to one of two branches                    | You're A/B testing or sampling                         |
| **Switch**       | Route based on multiple conditions                       | You have several possible paths                        |
| **Variables**    | Create and store values for later use                    | You need to maintain state across nodes                |

<Warning>
  **Script actions** execute arbitrary JavaScript. Use caution with external
  inputs and always validate data before processing.
</Warning>

### Human Review

The **Human Review** node pauses your workflow and sends a message to Slack, allowing a team member to approve, decline, or edit the content before the workflow continues. This is essential for workflows where you need human oversight before taking action—such as sending personalized outreach, updating CRM records, or executing high-stakes operations.

**How it works:**

1. When the workflow reaches the Human Review node, it posts a message to your configured Slack channel
2. The message displays your content along with three buttons: **Approve**, **Decline**, and **Edit**
3. The workflow pauses and waits for someone to respond
4. Based on the response, the workflow continues down one of two branches

**Configuration options:**

| Property      | Description                                                                                                                         |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Connector** | Select your Slack integration. Make sure the integration is already added to the target channel.                                    |
| **Channel**   | The Slack channel or user DM where the review request will be posted.                                                               |
| **Title**     | The message title that appears as the username in Slack. Supports expressions like `{{input.company_name}} - Review`.               |
| **Content**   | The content to be reviewed. This is displayed in a formatted block within the Slack message. Supports expressions for dynamic data. |
| **Timeout**   | Maximum time to wait for a response before timing out. Defaults to **24 hours** if not specified.                                   |

**Workflow branches:**

The Human Review node has two output branches:

- **Branch 1 (Approved):** The reviewer clicked "Approve" or "Edit" (with modifications). The workflow continues with the approved or edited content.
- **Branch 2 (Declined):** The reviewer clicked "Decline". Use this branch to handle rejections—skip the action, log the decision, or trigger an alternative flow.

<Note>
  The **Edit** button allows reviewers to modify the content before approving.
  The edited content is passed to the Approved branch, so your downstream nodes
  receive the human-modified version.
</Note>

<Tip>
  **Best practice:** Add meaningful context in your title and content fields.
  Include relevant data like company name, contact info, or the action about to
  be taken so reviewers can make informed decisions quickly.
</Tip>

---

## AI

AI actions leverage large language models to process, generate, and understand content.

<Note>AI actions are available in **Tools** and **Plays** only.</Note>

| Action          | Description                                                                                                                 |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **File search** | Search through files and documents using semantic understanding. Find relevant content based on meaning, not just keywords. |
| **Model ask**   | Query an LLM with a prompt. Generate text, analyze data, extract information, or make decisions.                            |

<Tip>
  AI actions consume credits based on token usage. Check the node picker for
  current pricing per 1K tokens.
</Tip>

---

## Sales

Sales actions are purpose-built for revenue operations, replicating complex routing and scoring logic.

<Note>Sales actions are available in **Tools** and **Plays** only.</Note>

| Action       | Description                                                                                                                 |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Allocate** | Distribute leads to team members based on rules. Supports round-robin, territory-based, and capacity-weighted distribution. |
| **Scoring**  | Create scoring models to evaluate records. Determine lead priority and potential value based on business rules.             |

<Tip>
  Learn more about lead distribution in the [revenue organization
  guide](/reference/revenue-organization/allocating-leads).
</Tip>

## Storage

Storage actions interact with data models in your Cargo workspace, enabling data persistence and retrieval.

<Note>Storage actions are available in **Tools** and **Plays** only.</Note>

| Action                  | Description                                              |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Memory**              | Key/value store for temporary data during a workflow run |
| **Model custom column** | Set custom column values on existing records             |
| **Model record**        | Add new records to your data models                      |
| **Model search**        | Query your data models with filters and conditions       |
| **Model vector search** | Perform semantic searches using vector-based queries     |

<Tip>
  Storage actions work with your Cargo data models. Make sure you've [set up
  your models](/reference/resources/models/overview) before using these actions.
</Tip>

### Memory

The **Memory** action provides a key/value store for persisting data across nodes. Use it to save values early in your workflow and retrieve them later—without passing data through every intermediate node.

**Scope options:**

| Scope         | Behavior                                          |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **Workspace** | Data is shared across all plays in your workspace |
| **Play**      | Data is isolated to the current play              |

**Available actions:**

| Action         | Description                                            |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Get**        | Retrieve a value by its key                            |
| **Set**        | Store a value at a key (overwrites existing)           |
| **Get or Set** | Return existing value, or set a default if none exists |
| **Increment**  | Add to a numeric value (useful for counters)           |
| **Decrement**  | Subtract from a numeric value                          |
| **Remove**     | Delete a key and its value                             |

**Configuration options:**

| Property  | Description                                                                                                                                |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Scope** | Choose between `Workspace` (shared) or `Play` (isolated).                                                                                  |
| **Key**   | A unique identifier for the stored value. Use descriptive names like `original_company_name` or `enrichment_result`. Supports expressions. |
| **Value** | (Set/Get or Set only) The value to store. Can be any data type—strings, numbers, objects, or arrays. Supports expressions.                 |

**Common use cases:**

- **Preserve original data** — Save input values before transformations so you can reference them later
- **Build counters** — Use Increment to track how many times a play has run or count leads processed
- **Cache enrichment results** — Store API responses to avoid duplicate calls within the same workflow
- **Share state across plays** — Use Workspace scope to share data between different plays
- **Implement rate limiting** — Track request counts with Increment/Decrement

<Tip>
  Use the **Increment** action to build simple counters—track how many times a
  play has run, count leads processed today, or implement rate limiting logic.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Best practice:** Use clear, descriptive key names that indicate what's being
  stored and why. This makes your workflows easier to understand and debug.
</Tip>

### Model Search

![Use a model search node](/images/enrol-data-in-plays-1.png)

Search and retrieve records from any data model or dataset in your workspace. This action queries your data and returns matching records that you can use in subsequent steps.

**Common use cases:**

| Use case                 | Example                                                  |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Find related records** | Look up all contacts at a company when a deal is created |
| **Check for duplicates** | Search for existing leads before creating new ones       |
| **Aggregate data**       | Retrieve all recent activities for a given account       |
| **Cross-reference**      | Match records between different data sources             |

**Configuration:**

| Property    | Description                                                 |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Model**   | The data model to search (e.g., Contacts, Companies, Deals) |
| **Filters** | Conditions that records must match                          |
| **Limit**   | Maximum number of records to return                         |
| **Sort**    | Order results by a specific field                           |

<Tip>
  Use expressions in your filter values to create dynamic searches. For example, filter by `{{nodes.start.company_domain}}` to find records related to the triggering record.
</Tip>

### Model Record

![Use a model record node](/images/enrol-data-in-plays-2.png)

Create new records in compatible data models directly from your workflows. This action allows you to write structured data back to models that support record creation.

**Supported data models:**

| Model type      | Support                              |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **HTTP models** | ✅ Full support for creating records |
| All others      | ❌ Not supported                     |

<Warning>
  Data models synchronized from external services like CRMs don't support
  creating records with this action. Use the dedicated write actions for each
  service (e.g., HubSpot Create Contact, Salesforce Create Lead) to ensure
  proper data sync.
</Warning>

**Data type behavior:**

When you create a new record, the first value written to each field determines its data type. This type cannot be changed afterward, so plan your schema carefully before writing production data.

### Model Custom Column

![Use a custom column node](/images/enrol-data-in-plays-3.png)

Extend synchronized data models with additional columns without modifying the source system. Custom columns let you store Cargo-specific metadata, flags, or computed values alongside your CRM or warehouse data.

**Examples of custom columns:**

- Lead scoring values calculated by your workflows
- Enrichment timestamps for tracking data freshness
- Processing flags like `needs_review` or `outreach_sent`
- Aggregated metrics from other data sources

**Configuration:**

| Property        | Description                                                 |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Model**       | The data model to extend with a custom column               |
| **Record ID**   | The primary identifier of the record to update              |
| **Column name** | Name for the custom column (creates it if it doesn't exist) |
| **Value**       | The data to write to this column                            |

**Finding the correct Record ID:**

| Scenario                        | How to get the ID                                                   |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Same data model as play trigger | Use `{{nodes.start._id}}`                                           |
| Different data model            | Use a Model Search action to find the record, then reference its ID |
| Known external ID               | Use the external system's ID (e.g., HubSpot contact ID)             |

<Note>
  If you're updating records in the same data model that triggered your play, `{{nodes.start._id}}` is the simplest approach. For cross-data-model updates, always use a Model Search action first to locate the target record.
</Note>

### Model Vector Search

Perform semantic searches using vector-based queries. This action finds records based on meaning and similarity rather than exact matches—ideal for finding related content, similar companies, or matching leads to ideal customer profiles.

### Storage best practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Use Model Search to validate before writing">
    Before creating or updating records, search for existing entries to prevent
    duplicates. This is especially important when processing data from multiple
    sources.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Store enrichment metadata in custom columns">
    Track when records were last enriched, which providers were used, and
    whether the enrichment succeeded. This helps you avoid re-processing records
    unnecessarily.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Scope memory appropriately">
    Use play-scoped memory for play-specific state (like deduplication within a
    run) and workspace-scoped memory for cross-play coordination (like global
    rate limiting).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Handle empty search results">
    Model Search actions can return zero results. Add a Branch action to check
    for empty results and handle them gracefully—either skip processing or
    create a new record.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Integrations

Integration actions connect Cargo to external platforms. Each integration provides a set of actions specific to that platform.

### Common actions

| Action        | Description                                          |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Insert**    | Create new records in the connected system           |
| **Find**      | Retrieve a specific record by ID                     |
| **Match**     | Check if a record exists based on criteria           |
| **Search**    | Find multiple records based on filters               |
| **Update**    | Modify existing records                              |
| **Upsert**    | Insert or update based on matching criteria          |
| **Delete**    | Remove records from the connected system             |
| **Associate** | Link two records together (e.g., contact to company) |

---

## Tools

Call other Cargo tools from within your workflows. This lets you compose complex automations from smaller, reusable building blocks.

**Use cases:**

- **Modular design** — Build small, focused tools and combine them into larger workflows
- **Reuse logic** — Share common operations (like enrichment or CRM writes) across multiple plays
- **Abstraction** — Hide complexity behind a simple tool interface

<Tip>
  When a tool is used inside another tool or play, it runs as a sub-workflow
  with its own inputs and outputs.
</Tip>

---

## Agents

Invoke AI agents from within your workflows. Agents can handle complex, multi-step tasks that require reasoning and decision-making.

**Use cases:**

- **Research tasks** — Have an agent gather and synthesize information
- **Dynamic decisions** — Let the agent choose the best action based on context
- **Complex workflows** — Delegate multi-step processes to an autonomous agent
