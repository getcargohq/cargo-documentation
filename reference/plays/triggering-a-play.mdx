Plays can process records in batches—either in real-time when changes are detected, or on a predefined schedule. This page explains how to configure schedules, change detection modes, enrolment rules, and health monitoring.

<Note>
  The minimum sync interval depends on the model type—it may be as short as 5
  minutes, 30 minutes, or up to 1 day. If you select an interval shorter than
  the allowed minimum or the model was already refreshed during that period, the
  sync will be skipped.
</Note>

## Schedule types

Configure when and how your play triggers:

| Type           | Description                                                       |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Manual**     | Enrol records manually via the `Enroll manually` button           |
| **Real-time**  | Trigger your play instantly when changes are detected             |
| **Interval**   | Schedule your play to run on a set interval (e.g., once per hour) |
| **Cron**       | Schedule your play using a cron expression for precise timing     |
| **Dependency** | Schedule after another play finishes running                      |

<Info>
  Real-time triggers are currently only available for **HubSpot** and
  **Salesforce** integrations.
</Info>

When using **Interval** scheduling, you can select a frequency (e.g., every 12 hours). All syncs are scheduled in UTC.

## Conditions

Use **Filters** to control which records are eligible to trigger the play. Only records matching your filter conditions will be enrolled.

## Changes mode

The **Changes** section controls which types of data changes trigger the play. The available options depend on your schedule type.

### For Real-time schedules

| Mode                            | Behavior                                                                    |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Created records only**        | Only newly created records that match the conditions will be enrolled       |
| **Created and updated records** | Both created and updated records that match the conditions will be enrolled |

### For Interval, Cron, and Dependency schedules

| Mode                        | Behavior                                                                       |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **New records only**        | Only new records that match the conditions will be enrolled in the play        |
| **New and updated records** | New and updated records that match the conditions will be enrolled in the play |
| **Full**                    | Process all matching records, regardless of whether they've changed            |
| **Custom**                  | Advanced mode for custom change detection logic                                |

## Enrolment rules

Control how the play handles records that trigger multiple times:

| Rule                             | Behavior                                                                                  |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Always enrol**                 | Enrol the record into a new play run every time the trigger fires for that record         |
| **Enrol once**                   | Only enrol each record once, even if the trigger fires multiple times for the same record |
| **If is not currently enrolled** | Only enrol a record if it's not already in an active run, preventing concurrent runs      |

## Health monitoring

Monitor the health of your play runs and set up alerts:

- **Batch Health threshold** — Set the percentage of runs that need to be successful for a batch to be considered healthy (0-100%)
- **Health alert** — Configure a Slack notification to be alerted when a batch falls below your health threshold
