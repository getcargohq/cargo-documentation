description: Learn how to configure sync settings and trigger conditions for plays

Once enabled, plays can process records in batches. You can configure how often the play checks for new data and how many records to process at once using the sync settings.

For instance, the play may process in real-time for HTTP webhooks, or run only on a predefined weekly schedule (twice a day, only on working days).

Sync settings allow you to control:
- **Processing frequency:** How often the play checks for new data
- **Batch size:** How many records to process at once
- **Schedule:** When the play should run (real-time, hourly, daily, etc.)
- **Filtering:** Which records should trigger the play

## Trigger conditions

When dealing with repeated records, workflows can be set to handle different scenarios:

### Resync schedule

Configure how often the segment resyncs with the data model feeding the workflow to look for changes.

### Always Enroll

Starts the workflow every time a change is noticed, regardless of prior workflow runs. Useful for acting on every change quickly.

### Enroll if Not Executing

Starts the workflow only if the record isn't currently being processed. Helps avoid duplication from high-frequency enrollments.

### No Re-Enrollment

Ensures that once a record has gone through the workflow, it won't trigger again. Ideal for processing each record only once and avoiding further actions on subsequent changes.

### New Record Additions

Triggers the workflow when new records are added. Essential for immediate actions on new information, like adding new customers.

### Record Deletions

Starts workflows when records are removed. Useful for data cleanup and triggering follow-up actions.

### Record Updates

Triggers workflows when specific details in a record are changed, ensuring actions are based on the latest data. This option allows tracking a certain column to track for updates, as opposed to tracking all the columns in a segment.

### No Record Updates

Triggers workflows when no result in a record is changed. This option allows tracking a certain column to track for updates, as opposed to tracking all the columns in a segment.

## Sync configuration

### Processing frequency

Choose how often your play should check for new data:

- **Real-time:** Process changes immediately (for webhook-based models)
- **Every minute:** High-frequency processing for time-sensitive operations
- **Every hour:** Regular processing for most business workflows
- **Daily:** Batch processing for non-urgent operations
- **Weekly:** Periodic processing for maintenance tasks
- **Custom schedule:** Define your own cron expression for specific timing

### Batch size

Control how many records are processed in each sync cycle:

- **Small batches (1-10):** For real-time processing and immediate actions
- **Medium batches (10-100):** For most business workflows
- **Large batches (100+):** For bulk operations and data processing

### Schedule configuration

Set up specific timing for your sync operations:

- **Business hours only:** Process only during working hours
- **Weekdays only:** Skip weekend processing
- **Specific times:** Run at particular times of day
- **Multiple times per day:** Process several times daily

### Filtering options

Define which records should trigger your play:

- **All records:** Process every change in the data model
- **Filtered records:** Only process records that match specific criteria
- **Segmented records:** Process only records in specific segments
- **Custom conditions:** Use complex logic to determine which records to process
