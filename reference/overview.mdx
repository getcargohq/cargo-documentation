Cargo is built around a set of core concepts that work together to automate, analyze, and optimize your go-to-market operations:

- [**Tools**](/reference/tools) are modular building blocks for repeatable actions, such as data enrichment, outreach, or integration. Use them on their own or as part of larger workflows.
- [**Agents**](/reference/agents) are AI-powered components that leverage tools and data to perform research, analysis, or decision-making tasks.
- [**Plays**](/reference/plays) are automated workflows that orchestrate tools and logic, triggered by changes in your data models. Plays let you automate complex business processes end-to-end.
- [**Data models**](/reference/data/system-of-record) provide the structured foundation for your workspace, organizing information and powering automations. They can connect to your data warehouse or use Cargoâ€™s built-in storage.
- [**Lead allocation**](/reference/allocation) is a specialized feature for handling workload distribution and territory management for revenue operations teams.

Use this **reference** section to find detailed explanations, implementation guides, and best practices for each concept. Each page is organized by topic, so you can quickly locate the information you need to build on your Cargo workspace.
