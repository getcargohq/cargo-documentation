Cargo is built around five interconnected concepts that work together to automate, analyze, and optimize your revenue operations. Understanding how they relate is key to building powerful workflows.

## Core concepts

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Tools" icon="wrench" href="/reference/tools/overview">
    Modular building blocks for repeatable actions—enrichment, outreach,
    integrations, and more. Use standalone or chain together in workflows.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Agents" icon="robot" href="/reference/agents/overview">
    AI-powered components that leverage tools and data to perform research,
    analysis, and autonomous decision-making.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Plays" icon="diagram-project" href="/reference/plays/overview">
    Automated workflows that orchestrate tools and logic, triggered by data
    changes. Build complex end-to-end business processes.
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="Data models"
    icon="database"
    href="/reference/resources/overview"
  >
    The structured foundation of your workspace. Connect your data warehouse or
    use Cargo's built-in storage to power automations.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Card

  href="/reference/revenue-organization/overview"
>
  Specialized routing and territory management for revenue operations teams.
  Distribute workload intelligently based on rules you define.
</Card>

## How it all connects

<Steps>
  <Step title="Data flows in">
    Your data models pull from warehouses, CRMs, or Cargo's native
    storage—creating a unified view of accounts, contacts, and activities.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Plays trigger on changes">
    When data changes (new records, updated fields, time-based conditions),
    plays automatically kick off to process the change.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Tools and agents execute">
    Plays orchestrate tools for enrichment, outreach, and integrations. Agents
    handle complex reasoning when deterministic logic isn't enough.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Results sync back">
    Outputs flow back to your data models, CRM, or downstream systems—closing
    the loop and triggering the next action.
  </Step>
</Steps>
