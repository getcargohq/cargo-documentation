Cargo's allocation system distributes leads across your sales organization based on configurable rules. This guide covers each component—from importing team members to tracking allocation history.

## Members

When you connect a tool containing your sales organization (such as a CRM), Cargo automatically imports team members and keeps them synchronized. This creates a unified view of your team across your workspace.

You can enhance member profiles with custom metadata—such as spoken languages, mailboxes, or specializations—to personalize how leads are assigned.

## Territories

Territories group members into logical units that reflect your sales structure. Common examples include:

- Geographic regions (EMEA, APAC, Americas)
- Industry verticals (Healthcare, Finance, Technology)
- Company size segments (Enterprise, Mid-market, SMB)

Each territory can have a **fallback member** who receives allocations when all other members reach their capacity limits.

## Capacity

Capacity configurations set maximum allocation limits per member within a defined timeframe. This ensures fair workload distribution and prevents rep overload. For example, you might set a capacity of 3 leads per day to match your team's average sales cadence.

<Note>
  Capacities are calculated independently. A member can be available for
  allocation under one capacity configuration while being fully booked under
  another.
</Note>

## Allocation node

The allocation node is where leads get assigned to members. By default, it uses **round-robin** distribution, spreading assignments evenly across available reps.

You can configure the allocation node to match leads based on:

- **Email address** — Route based on the lead's email domain
- **Territory** — Assign to members within a specific territory
- **Static list** — Choose from a predefined set of members
- **Connector matching** — Use data from connected tools to determine ownership

<Note>
  The allocation node requires a reliable record ID to track each lead
  assignment internally.

## Capacity model mapping

For complex allocation logic, capacity model mapping calculates member availability based on data in a Cargo model—such as open deals or active opportunities.

<Note>
  Data models used for capacity mapping must be transactional objects (like CRM
  deals), where one record represents one allocation unit.
</Note>

To configure capacity model mapping:

1. Select a transactional data model (e.g., CRM deals)
2. Add a filter to identify the deal owner using a model column
3. Use a Cargo expression to match members: `{{member.ids.<connector_name>}}`

This approach lets you factor in real pipeline data when determining who should receive the next lead.

## Allocation history

Every sales organization element—members, territories, and capacities—has a dedicated history screen that logs all allocations. Each entry links to the specific play run that triggered the assignment.

Use allocation history to:

- Verify that distribution rules are working as expected
- Troubleshoot assignment issues
- Audit lead routing decisions

## Allocation fallback

Fallback rules ensure every lead gets assigned, even when primary routing fails. Cargo provides two fallback mechanisms:

- **Territory fallback** — Each territory can designate a fallback member who receives allocations when all other members exhaust their capacity.
- **Retry on failure** — Configure the allocation node to continue attempting assignment until successful, ensuring no lead is left unassigned.
