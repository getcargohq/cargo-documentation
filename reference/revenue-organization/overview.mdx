Revenue Organization in Cargo provides a complete system for managing your sales team structure and automating lead distribution. It keeps your team hierarchy synchronized with your CRM while giving you fine-grained control over how leads flow to the right reps.

---

## Core concepts

Revenue Organization consists of three interconnected components that work together to route leads intelligently:

| Concept        | Description                                                                                        |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Members**    | Your sales team imported from connected CRMs, enriched with custom metadata like languages and specializations. |
| **Territories**| Logical groupings of members by region, vertical, or segment—each with optional fallback assignments. |
| **Capacities** | Workload limits that ensure fair distribution and prevent rep overload.                            |

## How it works

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[New Lead] --> B[Allocation Node]
    B --> C{Match Rules}
    C --> D[Territory]
    C --> E[Email Domain]
    C --> F[Connector Match]
    D --> G[Available Rep]
    E --> G
    F --> G
    G --> H[CRM Assignment]
```

1. **Leads enter** through a play trigger
2. **Matching rules** determine which reps are eligible
3. **Capacity checks** filter to available team members
4. **Round-robin** distributes evenly among eligible reps
5. **Assignment syncs** back to your CRM

## Key features

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **CRM sync** | Team members automatically import and stay synchronized with Salesforce, HubSpot, or other connected CRMs |
| **Territory routing** | Route leads based on geographic regions, industry verticals, or company size segments |
| **Capacity management** | Set daily, weekly, or custom limits per rep to balance workloads |
| **Fallback rules** | Ensure every lead gets assigned, even when primary routing fails |
| **Allocation history** | Full audit trail of every assignment with links to the triggering play run |
| **Model-based capacity** | Calculate availability from real pipeline data like open deals |
