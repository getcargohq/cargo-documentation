## Using the extension

### Inside your CRM

When viewing a contact, company, or deal in HubSpot or Salesforce, the extension adds a Cargo sidebar:

1. Navigate to a record in your CRM
2. Click the Cargo icon in your browser toolbar (or use the sidebar if enabled)
3. Choose an agent to run—the extension automatically pulls context from the page (CRM record details, visible data) and passes it to the agent
4. View results in the sidebar and let them sync back to your CRM

**Example workflow:**

- View a company in HubSpot
- Click the Cargo icon
- Run "Enrich & Score Lead"
- See results in the sidebar

<Note>
  The extension reads data from your CRM page to provide context. No additional
  CRM permissions are required beyond what Cargo already has.
</Note>

### On any webpage

Analyze any webpage with your Cargo agents:

1. Navigate to any webpage (company website, LinkedIn profile, news article)
2. Click the Cargo icon in your toolbar
3. Select an agent
4. The agent can read and analyze the current page content
5. Ask questions or run workflows based on what's on the page

**Use cases:**

- Research a prospect's company website before a call
- Summarize a news article about a target account
- Extract contact information from a LinkedIn profile
- Analyze competitor pricing pages

### Quick actions

Access your most-used tools instantly:

1. Click the Cargo icon from any tab
2. See your pinned agents and tools
3. Run with one click—enter inputs manually if needed
4. View results directly in the extension popup

## Configuring the extension

### Available agents

By default, the Chrome extension gives you access to:

- **Master Agent** — A general-purpose agent built by Cargo, ready to use out of the box
- **All workspace agents** — Every agent you've deployed in your Cargo workspace

### Customizing available agents

You can control which agents appear in the Chrome extension:

1. Open Cargo and navigate to **Settings**
2. Select **Cargo for Chrome**
3. In the **Available agents** section, enable or disable specific agents
4. Save your changes

This lets you curate the agent list for your team—hide agents that aren't relevant for browser-based work, or keep the list focused on your most-used workflows.

### Selecting a default agent

You can also choose which agent opens by default when you launch the extension:

1. In **Settings → Cargo for Chrome**, find the **Default agent** dropdown
2. Choose your preferred agent
3. Save your changes

The selected agent will automatically load whenever you open the extension, saving you a click on every use.

<Tip>
  Set your most-used agent as the default. You can always switch to a different
  agent from the extension's agent selector.
</Tip>

## Best practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Set a default agent for faster access">
    Configure your most-used agent as the default in **Settings → Cargo for
    Chrome**. This loads your preferred agent instantly when you open the
    extension.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Curate your agent list">
    Disable agents you don't need in the extension settings. A focused list
    makes it faster to find the right agent for browser-based work.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Use page context effectively">
    Your agent can read the current page content. Be specific in your
    prompts—ask "What does this company do?" or "Summarize the key points on
    this page" to get targeted results.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Leverage CRM context">
    When viewing a CRM record, the extension automatically pulls in record
    details. Use this to run enrichment, qualification, or research without
    re-entering data.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
