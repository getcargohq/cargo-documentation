title: "Files"
description: "Unstructured data resources like documents, PDFs, and knowledge bases"

Files are unstructured data resources that power your Cargo agents and workflows. Unlike structured [data models](/reference/resources/models/overview), files contain documents, PDFs, transcripts, and other text content that can be searched semantically.

---

## What are files?

Files connect your workspace to **unstructured data**—documents, PDFs, and text content. When used as resources in agents or tools, the system searches this content using vector similarity to find relevant information.

**Best for:**

- Knowledge Bases (Notion, Google Docs, uploaded files)
- Playbooks, FAQs, and process documentation
- Meeting transcripts and call notes
- Product documentation and guides

## How files work

When you add files as a resource:

1. **Content is indexed** — Files are processed and converted into searchable chunks
2. **Vector embeddings** — Each chunk is converted to a vector representation for semantic search
3. **Retrieval** — When queried, the most relevant chunks are retrieved based on meaning, not just keywords

<Note>
  Vector search finds content by meaning, not exact text matches. A query for
  "pricing concerns" will find content about "cost objections" or "budget
  questions" even if those exact words aren't used.
</Note>

  <Card title="Direct upload" icon="upload">
    Upload files directly to your Cargo workspace from your computer.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Connected sources" icon="link">
    Connect to Notion, Google Drive, or other document sources for automatic
    syncing.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Using files in agents

When configuring an [agent](/reference/agents/resources-and-context), you can add file resources to give it access to your organization's knowledge.

### Selecting content

Choose which files or folders to include. The agent will search all selected content using vector similarity to find relevant information.

### Adding context with prompts

Add custom instructions to guide how the agent interprets or prioritizes this content:

```
This folder contains our sales playbooks. Prioritize the
objection handling guide when the user asks about pricing concerns.
```

## Best practices

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Organize by topic">
    Group related files into folders so you can selectively grant access to
    specific knowledge areas.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Keep content current">
    Regularly update files to ensure agents have access to the latest
    information.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Use clear file names">
    Descriptive file names help both humans and agents understand content at a
    glance.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Test retrieval quality">
    Run test queries to verify the right content is being retrieved for common
    questions.
  </Card>
