title: "Querying Cargo data"
description: "Access your Cargo data models directly via SQL"
---

Every data model you create in Cargo is stored as a table in your connected data warehouse. You can query these tables directly using SQL—whether from your own BI tools, data pipelines, or within Cargo to create new SQL-based models.

---

## Table naming conventions

Cargo follows specific naming patterns for your data model tables. The format depends on your warehouse scope configuration.

### Database scope

```sql
[DATABASE].datasets_[CONNECTOR_SLUG].models_[MODEL_SLUG]
```

**Example:** If your database is `CARGO_DB`, your connector slug is `crm`, and your model slug is `companies`:

```sql
SELECT * FROM CARGO_DB.datasets_crm.models_companies
```

### Schema scope

If you configured schema-level scope when setting up your warehouse:

```sql
[DATABASE].[SCHEMA].datasets_[CONNECTOR_SLUG]__models_[MODEL_SLUG]
```

<Note>
  Notice the double underscore (`__`) between the connector slug and `models`
  when using schema scope.
</Note>

## Query examples

### Basic query

```sql
SELECT
  company,
  website,
  funding_amt,
  funding_type
FROM CARGO_DB.datasets_file.models_abm_raw
WHERE funding_amt > 1000000
```

### Joining multiple models

Combine data from different Cargo models:

```sql
SELECT
  a.company,
  a.website,
  b.enrichment_data,
  c.activity_score
FROM CARGO_DB.datasets_crm.models_companies a
LEFT JOIN CARGO_DB.datasets_enrichment.models_company_data b
  ON a.domain = b.domain
LEFT JOIN CARGO_DB.datasets_analytics.models_scores c
  ON a.company_id = c.company_id
```

### Aggregations

```sql
SELECT
  company,
  website,
  SUM(deal_value) as total_pipeline,
  COUNT(*) as deal_count
FROM CARGO_DB.datasets_crm.models_deals
WHERE stage != 'Closed Lost'
GROUP BY company, website
HAVING SUM(deal_value) > 10000
```

## Creating SQL models

You can create new Cargo data models by writing SQL queries against your existing tables. This is useful for combining data from multiple sources, applying transformations, or creating aggregated views.

![SQL model configuration](/images/sql-models-2.png)

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add a new SQL model">
    Navigate to your data models and create a new model. Select **SQL** as the object type.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Write your SQL query">
    Write a query that selects data from your existing Cargo tables using the naming conventions above.

    ```sql
    SELECT
      "company",
      "_emitted_at" AS emitted_at,
      "website",
      "hq",
      "funding_amt",
      "funding_type",
      "funding_date"
    FROM CARGO_DB.datasets_file.models_abm_lk
    ```

    <Warning>
      Do not include `_id`, `_time`, or `_title` columns in your query—these are system columns that Cargo generates automatically based on your column mapping.
    </Warning>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure column mapping">
    Map the required columns:
    - **ID** — The unique identifier for each record
    - **Title** — A human-readable label for records
  </Step>
  <Step title="Preview and save">
    Preview the query results to verify your data, then save the model.
  </Step>
</Steps>
