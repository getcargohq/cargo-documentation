description: "Structured tables that power your Cargo plays and workflows"
---

Data models are structured tables that power your Cargo plays. They contain organized data that can be imported into plays to create runs.

Cargo enables you to build data models from multiple sources—API endpoints, webhook events, and SQL queries—and merge them into a unified, cohesive structure.

<Note>
  Cargo uses a data warehouse infrastructure to host your models. By default,
  you'll get a managed Snowflake instance, or you can connect your own
  warehouse.
</Note>

## Data connectors

Cargo offers three types of data loaders to bring external data into your models:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Native integrations" icon="plug">
    Connect to supported external APIs (CRMs, enrichment tools, etc.) and fetch
    data directly into a model.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Webhook loader" icon="webhook">
    Listen for real-time events from external sources and import that data
    automatically.
  </Card>
  <Card title="SQL loader" icon="database">
    Run SQL queries on your data warehouse tables and import the results.

## Model capabilities

Data models support powerful capabilities to help you orchestrate your GTM workflows:

  <Accordion title="Segments" icon="filter">
    Apply filters to create targeted segments for specific plays based on custom
    criteria.

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Additional columns" icon="table-columns">

    - **Custom columns:** Free-form columns you can upsert from within a play
    - **Computed columns:** Calculated values based on other columns in the model
    - **Metrics columns:** Aggregated data (sums, averages, counts) from related models
