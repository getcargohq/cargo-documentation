SQL models provide powerful ways to interact with your data warehouse, enabling you to write data back to models, perform custom queries, and maintain data consistency across your systems.

## Writing data to models

Custom and HTTP models permit direct writing from workflows using a **model record node**.

Use the model record node to add new records to compatible data models. This node allows you to create records programmatically within workflows, maintaining a single source of truth for your business data.

**Configuration:** 
- Select the relevant data model
- Choose the insert action
- Pass the data object that will populate the record columns in a valid JSON (tip: passing an entire variables node will work)

## Writing data to warehouse

The **SQL write** node enables direct database operations inside a connected warehouse.

- **Insert:** Always creates a new row
- **Upsert:** Creates a new row if no matching row exists, otherwise updates it
- **Update:** Updates matching rows without creating new entries
- **Delete:** Removes matching rows

**Configuration steps:**
1. Enter database name and select schema/table
2. Choose the action to perform
3. Define matching criteria for non-INSERT operations
4. Specify data mapping for each column

## Custom SQL queries

Create powerful SQL-based data models that combine data from multiple sources.

Add an SQL connector to enable direct database access. The connector supports both BigQuery and Snowflake with consistent patterns for table structure: `[SCOPE].datasets_[CONNECTOR].models_[MODEL]`

### Creating SQL models

- **Step 1:** Add SQL model and configure database connection
- **Step 2:** Write SQL queries for your specific database (BigQuery or Snowflake)
- **Step 3:** Configure mapping for unique identifier, title, and timestamp columns
- **Step 4:** Preview and save the query
