Plays respond to real-time changes in model data. When changes match filter criteria, plays import records and create runs. Plays resync periodically (except webhook models which resync automatically as a new record is added).

### Create a segment

Apply filters to your data models to create targeted segments based on specific criteria. These filters can be saved as reusable segments for consistent data organization across your workflows.

### Modify the record enrolment settings

Segments enable plays to respond to real-time changes in your data. When data changes match your filter criteria, plays automatically import the relevant records and create runs to process them.
