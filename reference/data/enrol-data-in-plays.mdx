### Model search node

![Use a model search node](/images/enrolling-data-in-plays-1.png)

Search and retrieve model or dataset records. This node allows you to query data from any model in your workspace and use the results in your play.

### Model record node

Add record to a compatible data model. Some data models, such as HTTP, allow creating new records from within Cargo's plays.

> Data models coming from external services such as CRM don't support writing records using this node. In order to create new objects, use dedicated write nodes for the service in question (e.g., HubSpot write node).

When a new row is created using this node, the first value will determine the data type, which cannot be changed later.

### Model custom column node

![Use a custom column node](/images/enrolling-data-in-plays-3.png)

This node allows writing data to custom column, i.e. extending the data model that is synchronized from an external system with additional data points. For instance, you may want to add extra metadata about particular records or flag them.

> The ID required by this node needs to be the primary identifier of the data model. When the play is using the same data model, the record ID can be set to `nodes.start._id`. In case no primary ID is available in the play, consider using the model search node to locate the appropriate ID of the target record.

### Memory node

![Use a memory node](/images/enrolling-data-in-plays-4.png)

Store or access structured data using a key/value store approach.

> The node requires a scope (workspace or play level) and a unique key identifier. 

Available actions include getting, setting, getting or setting, incrementing, decrementing, and removing values from storage.
